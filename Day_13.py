# Debugging

# Decribe the problem 
#  Why is i not printing:

def my_func():
    for i in range(0, 20):
        if i == 20:
            print("You got it")


my_func()

#  range() gives us the 0-19, not including the second parameter. 
#  TO get 20 you would need to specify the range(0, 21)

# Similarly, in this case
from random import randint

dice_num = randint(0,5)
print(dice_img[dice_num])

# What about year 1994? < > are not inclusive.
#  So add = sign. I
