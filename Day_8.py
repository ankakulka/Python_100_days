# Return the ceiling of x, the smallest integer greater than or equal to x. 
# If x is not a float, delegates to x.__ceil__, 
# which should return an Integral value.

# Prime number are those that can be divided only by itself and 1 to get an integer

#  Range of numbers from 0-100

#  Iterate over the range - if not divisible by other numbers than one and self
#  then it is prime

#  In the range of divisio if True occurs more than two times - NOT prime
#  otherwise prim
