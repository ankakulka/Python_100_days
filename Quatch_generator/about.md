This is a simple __Quatch__* generator 
(*quatsch is German for nonsense or BS)

I was inspired by the Wolf Schneider's book with examples 
of cliches used in German that can be mixed and matched to create meaningless
sentences that can be used as fillers for various occasions.

While this is not an advanced NLP project, it seemed like a great opportunity 
to create a simple Python script and practice Python skills.
